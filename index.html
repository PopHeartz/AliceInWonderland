  <h1><u>Verbal Assets</u></h1>
  <p> <u>Alice and Flower Garden</u>
<p>Rose: What a funny looking creature.

<p>Alice: I could say the same thing about you.

<p>Rose: And a rude creature at that. I am not just any flower, I am a rose. Now what business do you have falling from the sky into MY garden?

<p>Alice: Well, you see, I was having the most dandy time playing on my swing when I noticed a little white rabbit running across the yard. I decided to follow it and now here I am…Where am I?

<p>Rose: You are in Wonderland, of course. Where else would you be? Did you hit your head on the way down?

<p>Alice: I don’t believe I did. Have you seen the white rabbit?

<p>Rose: There was a white rabbit here a little bit ago…

<p>Alice: You have? Oh, please tell me where it went. Surely it knows how to get home.

<p>Rose: If it did know, it wouldn’t be able to tell you anymore. I’ve turned it into something much more beautiful!

<p>Alice: Oh! How terrible. How will I make it home now?

<p>Rose: I would make this your new home but you are far too ugly for my garden.

<p>Alice: That’s very mean. I don’t even want to stay here anyway. My family is surely missing me. 

<p>Rose: Shame. If you’re only going to loiter, I don’t want you here. You’re ruining the scenery.

<p>Alice: Fine. I’ll leave. Your garden smells terrible anyway.


<p><u>Alice and Caterpillar</u>
<p>Alice: Hello?

<p>Caterpillar: …

<p>Alice: Hello??

<p>Caterpillar: …

<p>Alice: It’s rude to ignore when someone is talking to you, you know.

<p>Caterpillar: It’s rude to interrupt one’s meditation, you know

<p>Alice: Oh, I suppose you’re right. Could I ask you a quick question though?

<p>Caterpillar: …

<p>Alice: …I’m not from here-

<p>Caterpillar: That’s not a question.

<p>Alice: I wasn’t done-

<p>Caterpillar: Still not a question. A question typically has a question mark at the end of it.

<p>Alice: …Do you know how I can get home?

<p>Caterpillar: I don’t know where “home” is.

<p>Alice: Well, I don’t know where your home is but I live in Wyoming-

<p>Caterpillar: Never heard of it.

<p>Alice: It’s also rude to interrupt people…

<p>Caterpillar: Is that what you are? A people?

<p>Alice: Why do you want to know?

<p>Caterpillar: …

<p>Alice: And it’s rude to blow smoke in one’s face…

<p>Caterpillar: Then move out of my way.
  
<p>Alice: I would but…I feel dizzy.

<p>Caterpillar: You should have moved sooner then.

<p>Alice: Oh…yes, I suppose so.


<p><u>Alice, Mad Hatter, March Hare, and Dormouse at tea party</u>
<p>Mad Hatter & March Hare: Ring around the rosie, a pocket full of posies, ashes, ashes, we all fall down!

<p>Mad Hatter: The madame is awake!!

<p>Alice: Where am I??

<p>Mad Hatter: In Wonderland, of course! Where else??

<p>Alice: No, I mean…

<p>March Hare: She *means*...

<p>Alice: Oh, never mind. Neither of you know how I can get home-

<p>March Hare: Home is the place where…

<p>Mad Hatter: When you have to go there…

<p>March Hare: They take you in!

<p>Alice: No, no, no. You both are mad. Mad, I say!

<p>Mad Hatter: Mad…?

<p>March Hare: Oh dear, no good…

<p>Mad Hatter: I am NOT mad! I am a genius! Look at my hat! Dipped in just the precise amount of mercury to make it stiff…but not too stiff! 

<p>Alice: Yes, I see…

<p>Mad Hatter: You may see but you have not experienced!
